## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 12th, 2017
 * Where: Online (discord)

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Using Discord
    * Allowed us to communicate through text, images and voice chat. This gave us the ability to schedule meetings and share information efficiently.

* Google Docs
    * Using the Git Repo was tricky in this case (we could not see changes as they were being made which would result in duplicate text/points, as well as merge errors).  Working simultaneously on Google Documents was easier.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Skype
    * Skype did not work as a communication tool as one of our members was not able to connect to the sever. Instead, we switched to using Discord, which offers better organization (i.e. a built in voice chat channel).  

* Trello
    * Trello was not used as much as initially planned, as most of the planning and scheduling for our processes was done on Discord during the previous meeting.  



#### Planned changes

We are planning to host bi-weekly meetings as the development of the project continues - This is due to the fact that we will be working on heavier parts of the assignment.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

Completion of the artifact (template of the cue card as well as the website) was completed as planned.

* Artifacts that visualize parts of the product we wish to implement
    * [`Front of cue card`] (/mockups/questionFront.png)
    * [`Back of cue card`] (/mockups/questionBack.png)
    * [`Multiple choice card`] (/mockups/quiz.png)
    * [`User Interface`] (/mockups/userInterface.png)
    * [`Group interface`] (/mockups/groupInterface.png)
* Finalization and approval of the project idea.
* Complete design of interfaces
* Very detailed plans on what technologies we are using, in terms of database, api, programming languages
* Assigning each other specific tasks on implementation of the project


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

We have completed all the tasks that we intended to complete by the end of the iteration.

## Meeting Highlights

* Meetings
    * We decided to have more meetings every week in order to speed up the process of work - By only meeting once every week, we limited ourselves to the amount of work that we were able to complete as well as the discussion that we were able to have due to time constraints. By allocating more time for meetings (i.e. scheduling bi-weekly meetings), we increase our productivity.

* Prototype Development
    * In addition, we have decided to begin working on the website itself and implement some of the basics, for example, the general interface as well as some of the logistics. For this concept, we must also come up with detailed plans on what technologies such as which Frameworks we are using, what product we are using in order to deploy the website, and any additional APIs. We also assign each person relevant tasks.
