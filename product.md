#### Q1: What are you planning to build?


 Students often cram studying into a few days before a test or an exam and this often leads to poor retention of the material. Spaced repetition is a studying technique by spacing out each review of the material to improve retention. We are planning to build a spaced repetition cue-card webapp that help users memorize information. The product will remind the users to practice the information on the cue card using spaced repetition techniques. Users will be able to create classrooms for users to collaborate. The classroom will have the ability to hold class quizzes and to share decks of cue cards with other students in the class.

 With the ability to..
 * Create groups or classrooms
 * Share decks of cue cards
 * Hold group quizzes
 * Duels between users
 * Distinguish between tiers of cue cards (instructors, students, endorsed by instructors, etc.)
 * View their progress and get feedback



#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Used within a class for educational purposes:
* Students
	* Particularly high school students looking for an information hub to enhance their     
learning. They are the individuals who want to pool their knowledge with their peers to
gain a greater understanding of a topic.  
* Instructors
    * Teachers who want to create an environment for their students where they can work together to learn.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Users should choose our product as it is able to hone study habits while providing a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and cheaper alternative to traditional cue cards. Students and teachers are able to share their cards and study with other classmates in a test environment that cannot be gained from studying alone. Our product gives users the ability to track and view their own progress, while getting feedback in a systematic manner and aims to create a community that encourages learning. There currently exists a service called [`ANKI`](https://apps.ankiweb.net) that causes frustration with not being able to create groups and share cue cards.

### Highlights

* Alternatives:
    1.  Kijiji-like webapp specifically for textbooks
        * Allows students to buy used textbooks for a cheap price
        * Allows students to get a reimbursement on textbooks they no longer need by selling it to students who do
        * Voted against this idea because a solution had already existed and didnâ€™t want to handle the transfer of funds online

    2. Auto-scheduler
        * Input a list of tasks and arranges them automatically in your free time
Helps people with busy schedules make time for important tasks

    3. Repetition cue cards
        * A learning environment to help students study by automatically giving study cards through spaced-out notifications
        * An application that benefits us and something we can use
        * Helps students know where they are in learning and provides an efficient way to specifically find out which part they need to work on more
        * We chose this because it is more relevant to us as students. Frustration comes along when the course material is very challenging, and it becomes difficult to figure out which parts we need to focus heavily on. Getting to efficiently study using cue cards and also being able to get feedback themselves will help us with our study.
